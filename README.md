We used ANN using Keras to classify tumors in Malignant or Benign type, when provided with the tumor's dimensions. In the output we will have probability of tumor belonging to either Malignant or Benign class. The project has 3 primary segments:
1. Data pre-processing and quick analysis
2. Building ANN
3. Making Predictions
4. Other Models
5. Final Results
